          <!-- CONDICIONES GENERALES -->
          <div>
            <p class="legal-title">A. General Conditions</p>
            <p>1. The National Institute for Tourism Promotion (hereinafter "INPROTUR") created, through its Directorate of International Promotion, the program called "TESOROS ARGENTINOS" (hereinafter, the "Program") for assigning points through the consumption made exclusively by foreign tourists visiting the Argentine Republic (hereinafter "Tourist User"). These points may be used exclusively in the Program, through an exchange platform created for this purpose by INPROTUR together with the company Bigbox S.A., CUIT 30-71109155-2. The exchange platform was developed especially for the Program.</p>
            <p>The consumptions made by national tourists and/or national and foreign legal entities are expressly excluded from the Program.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br>
          <br>
          <!-- ADQUISION DE PUNTOS -->

          <div>
            <p class="legal-title">B. Acquisition of points</p>
            <p>1. Tourist Users who make the purchase of a ticket or tourist package to the Argentine Republic between the dates 01/01/2023 and 12/31/2023 or until the stock available for the Program runs out, will receive a âGift Card â personal and non-transferable to spend only in the Argentine territory during your stay in that country. This benefit will apply to tickets or packages purchased from transport companies and/or agencies selected by INPROTUR to promote the benefit.</p>

            <p>2. In the case of the Buquebus river company, the Program will be implemented only for passengers who purchase Tourist Packages (combo of Ticket and Lodging).</p>

            <p>
                3. In order to access the Program, those who buy the ticket or tourist package on the established dates must have a nationality other than Argentina, since the Program is aimed at promoting international tourism in Argentina. For this reason, people who only have Argentine nationality will not participate in the Program.
            </p>

            <p>4. The aforementioned purchase of tickets between the dates 01/01/2023 and 12/31/2023 must have been made once the campaign was launched with each corresponding company. The benefit is not retroactive: people who have bought before the company launches the advertising campaign will not participate in the Program.</p>

            <p>5. The benefit of the Program will be displayed in the form of points, which will be awarded based on the official exchange rate between the US dollar and the Argentine peso on the date INPROTUR sends the e-mails with the invitation to the beneficiaries, according to what is established in point B.10.</p>

            <p>6. The aforementioned points accumulation ratios may be modified at the discretion of INPROTUR. Fractions of Points will not be computed.</p>

            <p>7. The points accumulated in the Program do not constitute property of the tourist Users. The points are not transferable to any other person or entity or under any title or cause and may not be transferred to any other Program account, except with the express consent of INPROTUR.</p>

            <p>8. The points accumulated in the Program have no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for money.</p>

            <p>9. When making the purchase of the ticket during the indicated dates, the issuing tourist company or agency will send INPROTUR the following data of the tourist who has made the purchase: name and surname, email, date of entry and exit to the Argentine Republic. This data will only be shared for the purpose of proceeding with the creation of your Gift Card to assign the points obtained in the Program, according to the number of days that your stay in the Argentine Republic lasts.</p>

            <p>10. INPROTUR will inform the Tourist Users via e-mail about the points accumulated in the Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tourist Users may consult their Points through the âArgentine Treasuresâ Website.</p>

          <!-- ACTIVACION DE PUNTOS Y VIGENCIA -->
          <div>
            <p class="legal-title">C. Activation of points and validity</p>
              <p>1. In order to redeem the Points, the Tourist User must go through two instances. In the first place, you will have to accredit yourself on the âArgentine Treasuresâ Website, where you must complete the following information to be able to access and see the benefits offered:</p>
                 
              <p>
                - Name and surname <br>
                - Date of birth <br>
                - Gender <br>
                - Country of birth <br>
                - Country of residence <br>
                - Telephone <br>
                - Number of the identity document with which you will travel to Argentina<br>
                - Trip expectations<br>
                - Channel through which you found out about the benefit<br>
              </p>
                         
              <p>2. The âTesoros Argentinosâ Website will be available in three languages ââso that tourists can select the one they prefer. These languages ââare: Spanish, Portuguese and English. INPROTUR reserves the right to offer more languages ââif it deems it necessary.</p>
              
             <p>3. Secondly, the Tourist User must activate their benefit upon arrival in the Argentine Republic at the activation centers created for this purpose. This procedure is unavoidable: if the tourist does not activate the points in these venues, he will not be able to use the benefit.</p>
              
             <p>4. The points have a Term of Validity of 30 days from the date on which the activation is made in the physical activation sites arranged by INPROTUR in the territory of the Argentine Republic.</p>
             
             <p>5. The points that were not used by the tourist User during their stay in the Argentine Republic, for any reason or force majeure, or because 30 days have elapsed since their activation, will automatically return to INPROTUR in order to be used by new beneficiaries. In this way, once the period of 30 days has elapsed since its activation in activation venues, the tourist User will be left without a balance of points in his favor.</p>
          </div>

          <br><br>
          <!-- UTILIZACIÃN DE PUNTOS -->
          <div>
              <p class="legal-title">D. Use of points</p>
              <p>1. The tourist User may exchange the points for any of the Experiences offered in the Program, as long as he has the number of points necessary for said activity. The Experiences include and are limited to what is detailed on the "Argentine Treasures" Website and do not include transportation costs, extra services, laundry, tips, service fees or applicable taxes.</p>
               
              <p>2. The Tourist User (i) must contact the Provider directly (using the contact information provided on the âTesoros Argentinosâ Website) and reserve the date on which they wish to use the experience; or (ii) must manage the reservation of the Experience through the Website of "Argentine Treasures", in the event that said option is available for the specific Experience contracted. On said occasion, the Tourist User must provide the Code to the Provider so that it can verify its validity and that it can be used for the selected Experience. The date of the reservation may not be after the expiration of the Term of Validity.</p>
               
               <p>3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tourist User may contact the Provider and request the cancellation of the reservation, which must be made within the period indicated by the Provider at the time of making the reservation./p>
          </div>

          <br><br>

          <!-- OBLIGACIONES DEL USUARIO TURISTA -->
          <div>
          <p class="legal-title">E. Obligations of the Tourist User</p>
          <p>1. The Tourist User must choose the Experience of interest to him under his exclusive responsibility, as well as taking care of contacting the Provider and making the corresponding reservations. The offer by the Provider of the Experience in question will be subject to its availability, as well as its general rules and policies, including but not limited to rules and policies regarding admission and permanence, security, cancellations, minimum age and maximum, physical condition, and those that INPROTUR and/or Bigbox and/or the Provider could reasonably establish from time to time.</p>
